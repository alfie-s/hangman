## Rules of the game

The payer thinks of a word and tries to guess it by guessing one letter at a time.

There is a dash under each letter to give you a hint of how long the word is.

**Use your keyboard to input letters.**

Everytime a letter is guessed correctly it will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Everytime a letter is guessed incorrectly, it will appear in the wrong letters section.

You have until the hangman drawing is complete to guess all the letters before the game is up.
